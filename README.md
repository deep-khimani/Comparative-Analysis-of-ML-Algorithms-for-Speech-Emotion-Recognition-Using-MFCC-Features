# Comparative-Analysis-of-ML-Algorithms-for-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-Using-MFCC-Features
This project explores speech emotion recognition by extracting MFCC features from audio files and comparing the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, and MLPClassifier, to identify the most effective model.
